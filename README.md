## Description
Nxt2Neighbor is a revolutionary real estate application that brings community interests to the forefront of your house hunting experience. This application provides more than just house listings; it connects you with potential neighbors based on shared interests.

Built with the powerful Spring Framework, Nxt2Neighbor integrates the extensive real estate data from the Zillow API and combines it with our MySQL database for a comprehensive and efficient data management.

Upon signing up, users indicate their interests, forming a crucial component of our unique house recommendation algorithm. Once logged in, users can search for houses on sale. Every search fetches and combines data from both the Zillow API and our MySQL database, refining the information to align with the user's preferences and the interests of recent buyers in the area.

For sellers, Nxt2Neighbor offers a platform to list their houses for sale, providing important details like build year, number of rooms, and more.

Nxt2Neighbor is more than a housing application; it's a community builder. Find a house that's not just a perfect fit for you, but also situated in a neighborhood that shares your interests.
